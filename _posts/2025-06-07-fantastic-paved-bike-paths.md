## Introduction
I own a Brompton folding bike that I bring along on all my road trips.
It fits neatly into my car, taking up just a bit more than half the
space of the back-passenger seat. Whenever I reach a destination with a
bike path nearby, I love to unfold my bike and enjoy a leisurely ride. I
especially prefer riding along dedicated bike paths, away from the
hustle and bustle of urban areas. Below are some of the paths I've had
the pleasure of riding, and I'll gradually add more details about each
one as I continue to update this page.
